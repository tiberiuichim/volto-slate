# volto-slate: a Volto text editor

## Plugin configuration

There are multiple types of plugins:

1. `TextBlockEdit` extensions
2. `TextBlockEdit` keyboard handlers
3. `SlateEditor` plugins
4. `SlateEditor` extensions

To configure a new volto-slate plugin as in the (3) list item above, you need to do something like this:

1. create a new directory inside the `plugins` directory
2. inside it create an `index.js` file with contents similar to these:
```js
export default function install(config) {
  const settings = config.settings;
  settings.slate.buttons = [
    ...settings.slate.buttons,
    'block-quote': <BlockButton ... />
  ];

  return config;
}
```
3. add the reference to this install function inside the `plugins/index.js` file

## Available plugin extension points

Their initializations can be found inside `/src/editor/config.jsx`.

- `slate.buttons` - *Object*. Define new buttons as properties of this object with `string` keys
- `slate.toolbarButtons` - *List*. Add new buttons to the hovering toolbar
- `slate.expandedToolbarButtons` - *List*. Add new buttons to the expanded (fixed) toolbar
- `slate.elements` - *Object*. Define new block elements as properties of this object with `string` keys
- `slate.extensions` - *List*. Decorator functions receiving a Slate.js `Editor` instance and returning a modified `Editor` instance object
- `slate.nodeTypesToHighlight` - *List*. Slate.js type strings (e.g. `"paragraph"`, `"image"` etc.) for the types to be highlighted in the `SlateEditor`
- `slate.htmlTagsToSlate` - *Object*. Contains properties like this: if the property's key is `A`, the value of this property is a function receiving an `editor` parameter of type (Slate.js) `Editor` and an `el` Slate Element and this function handles link deserialization (`A` is the HTML tag name for links).

*TODO:* this list is not complete and actual.

### For all the extension points of List type listed above

If replacing it with a new list reference, please take into account the old list stored in the previous reference.

### In addition to the above extension points

Besides all these Volto Slate extension points there are all the other extension points of Volto for Volto Addons such as adding a new block type (the method of adding a new block type from a Volto Slate plugin is used in the `Footnote` plugin).

### Useful variables available for plugins

First of all, the Slate source code and docs are very helpful. Then the variables inside import path `volto-slate/utils`. Example:

```js
import { deconstructToVoltoBlocks } from 'volto-slate/utils';
```

Some of them are:

* `defaultListItemValue`

* `deconstructToVoltoBlocks`

  For this function to work well, the new content that should be separated from the rest of the Slate document by this function must not be on the first index inside the editor, but in the second or a later position. If a Volto Slate Text block has just a single node (restriction: only of type block) in the root Editor node, `deconstructToVoltoBlocks` does nothing. This is how `deconstructToVoltoBlocks` works currently (1st of October, 2020).
